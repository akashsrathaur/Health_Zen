# Daily Reset and Streak Fix Implementation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Task Cycle Counting Issue
**Problem**: Water intake count and other daily tasks were carrying over from yesterday instead of resetting to zero on daily basis.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `daily-reset-service.ts` to create completely fresh daily activities documents instead of merging
- Added proper reset tracking with `lastResetDay` field
- Tasks now properly reset to zero: water intake (0/8), sleep (0h), gym (0/60 minutes), etc.

### 2. Data Archiving
**Problem**: Previous day's data should be saved in tracker before reset.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `saveDailyData()` function in daily reset service
- Data is saved to `dailyHistory` collection with comprehensive daily summary
- Includes activities, points, streak, daily vibes, and challenges data

### 3. Streak Increment Logic
**Problem**: Streak should increment by +1 every day the user opens the app, not just when completing tasks.

**Solution**:
- Created new `app-opening.ts` action to handle daily app opening
- Added `handleDailyAppOpening()` function that tracks `lastAppOpenDate`
- Integrated with auth context to trigger on user authentication
- Streak now increments based on consecutive daily app usage

## Implementation Details

### New Files Added

#### `/src/actions/app-opening.ts`
- `handleDailyAppOpening()`: Core function to handle streak on app opening
- `handleAppInitialization()`: Combines app opening with reset check
- Tracks `lastAppOpenDate` and updates streak accordingly

#### `/src/scripts/test-daily-functionality.ts`
- Test functions to verify the implementation works correctly
- Can be used to manually test different scenarios

### Modified Files

#### `/src/lib/daily-reset-service.ts`
- Fixed `resetDailyMetrics()` to create fresh activities documents (not merge)
- Added `lastResetDay` field for proper reset tracking
- Enhanced data archiving in `saveDailyData()`

#### `/src/context/auth-context.tsx`
- Added app initialization call when user authenticates
- Handles both streak increment and daily reset check

#### `/src/hooks/use-app-services.ts`
- Removed redundant reset check (now handled in auth context)

## How It Works

### Daily App Opening Process
1. User opens the app
2. Auth context detects authenticated user
3. `handleAppInitialization()` is called
4. Checks if this is first app opening today
5. If yes, increments streak based on consecutive usage
6. Updates `lastAppOpenDate` and `streak` fields
7. Also triggers daily reset check if needed

### Daily Reset Process
1. Scheduled to run at 11:59 PM daily
2. Can also be triggered when user opens app if reset was missed
3. Steps:
   - Save today's data to `dailyHistory` collection
   - Update streak based on user activity
   - Reset all daily metrics to zero
   - Create fresh `dailyActivities` document for new day
   - Reset daily vibes and challenges

### Streak Logic
- **New user**: Streak starts at 1 on first app opening
- **Consecutive days**: Increment streak by 1
- **Missed day**: Reset streak to 1 (opening today counts as new start)
- **Same day multiple openings**: No change to streak

## Database Schema Changes

### Users Collection
- Added `lastAppOpenDate` field (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Added `lastResetDay` field for proper reset tracking
- Enhanced `lastStreakUpdate` tracking

### Daily Activities Collection
- Documents now get completely reset (not merged)
- Added `resetAt` timestamp for tracking

### Daily History Collection
- Enhanced data structure with comprehensive daily summary
- Includes activities, vibes, challenges, and user progress

## Testing

The implementation can be tested using:

```typescript
import { runDailyFunctionalityTests } from './src/scripts/test-daily-functionality';

// Run all tests
await runDailyFunctionalityTests();
```

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Daily Tracking**: Tasks properly reset to zero each day
2. **Data Preservation**: Previous day's progress is saved before reset
3. **Better Streak System**: Rewards daily app usage, not just task completion
4. **Reliable Reset System**: Handles missed resets and edge cases
5. **Performance Optimized**: Efficient database operations and state management

## Edge Cases Handled

- User opens app multiple times same day
- User misses days and returns
- Timezone changes and date boundaries
- Firebase connection issues
- First-time users
- Reset failures and recovery

The implementation ensures consistent behavior across all scenarios while maintaining data integrity and user experience.
