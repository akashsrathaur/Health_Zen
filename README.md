## üîß Firebase Setup

### 1. Create Firebase Project
```bash
firebase login
firebase projects:create your-project-name
```

### 2. Enable Services

- **Firestore**: Create database in test mode, then deploy security rules

### 3. Deploy Security Rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### How to Get Your Keys

1.  **Firebase Keys**: You can get these by creating a Firebase project and a Web App within that project. In the Firebase console, go to **Project Settings** > **General**, and under "Your apps", you will find the Firebase SDK snippet with your configuration.

2.  **GEMINI_API_KEY**: You can get this for free from Google AI Studio.
    *   Go to [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/).
    *   Sign in and click **"Get API key"** in the top left.
    *   Click **"Create API key in new project"**.
    *   Copy the generated key.

## Deploying to Vercel

When you deploy your application to a hosting provider like Vercel, you must add the environment variables from your `.env` file to your Vercel project settings. **Your application will not build successfully without them.**

1.  **Go to your Vercel Project**: Open your project in the Vercel dashboard.
2.  **Navigate to Settings**: Click on the "Settings" tab.
3.  **Go to Environment Variables**: In the left-hand menu, click on "Environment Variables".
4.  **Add Your Keys**: For each variable in your `.env` file (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`), add it to Vercel.
    -   Copy the name (like `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`).
    -   Copy the corresponding value.
    -   Click "Save".
5. **Redeploy**: After adding all the variables, trigger a new deployment from the "Deployments" tab in Vercel. Your app will then build successfully with the correct keys.

### **Securing Firestore Database**

Security is paramount in Health Zen. Deploy the included security rules to protect user data:

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI globally
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Authenticate with Firebase
firebase login

# Deploy security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```
