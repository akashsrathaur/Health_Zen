# ‚úÖ FIXED: Daily Refresh Issues - Preserves Challenges & Tasks

## Problem Solved
- **‚ùå Before**: Daily reset was **deleting** user's joined challenges and custom tasks
- **‚úÖ Now**: Daily refresh **preserves** all challenges and only resets daily progress

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Daily Reset Logic** 
- Changed from **deleting** to **refreshing** daily progress
- Preserves all user-joined challenges and their progress
- Maintains custom tasks and user preferences
- Only resets daily completion status and metrics

### 2. **Challenge Preservation**
```javascript
// OLD (Bad): Challenges got reset/deleted
isCompletedToday: false // Lost all progress

// NEW (Good): Challenges preserved with progress
{
  ...challenge, // Keep ALL existing properties
  isCompletedToday: false, // Only reset today's completion
  currentDay: challenge.isCompletedToday ? currentDay + 1 : currentDay // Increment if completed
}
```

### 3. **Daily Vibes Preservation**
```javascript
// OLD (Bad): Custom tasks lost
resetVibe.value = 'Not set' // Lost user's custom values

// NEW (Good): Custom tasks preserved
{
  ...vibe, // Keep ALL existing properties (title, icon, custom values)
  progress: 0, // Only reset progress
  completedAt: undefined // Only reset completion time
}
```

### 4. **Water & Activity Tracking**
- **Water Intake**: Resets to `0/8 glasses` each day for fresh tracking
- **Sleep Hours**: Resets to `0h` - user can log how many hours they slept
- **Gym Minutes**: Resets to `0/60 minutes` for daily workout tracking
- **Historical Data**: All previous day's data is saved to `dailyHistory` collection

## New Features Added

### 1. **Restore Tasks Button**
- Click "Restore Tasks" if your challenges were accidentally deleted
- Restores default challenges and daily vibes if missing
- Safe to use - won't overwrite existing data

### 2. **Refresh Day Button** 
- Click "Refresh Day" to manually reset daily progress
- Preserves all your challenges and custom tasks
- Only resets today's completion status

### 3. **Safe Refresh Functions**
- `safeRefreshDailyTasks()` - Refreshes daily progress safely
- `restoreUserData()` - Restores missing challenges/tasks
- Both preserve user's enrolled challenges and custom configurations

## How Daily Refresh Now Works

### ‚úÖ What Gets Refreshed Daily:
- **Water Intake**: `4/8 glasses` ‚Üí `0/8 glasses` (fresh tracking)
- **Sleep Hours**: `7.5h` ‚Üí `0h` (ready for new day's sleep input)
- **Gym Minutes**: `45/60 minutes` ‚Üí `0/60 minutes` (fresh workout tracking)
- **Task Completion**: `‚úÖ Completed` ‚Üí `‚≠ï Available` (ready to complete again)
- **Challenge Daily Status**: `Done for today` ‚Üí `Available for today`

### üîÑ What Stays Preserved:
- **Challenge Enrollment** (you remain enrolled in challenges you joined)
- **Challenge Progress** (`Day 5 of 30` stays `Day 5 of 30`)
- **Streak Count** (based on actual daily activity)
- **Custom Task Names** (your custom tasks keep their names/icons)
- **Total Points** (lifetime points accumulation)
- **User Profile** (all settings and preferences)

## Usage Instructions

### For Immediate Fix (If Data Lost):
1. **Click "Restore Tasks"** button in dashboard
2. This will restore your default challenges and daily vibes
3. Your water, sleep, gym tracking will work normally

### For Daily Use:
1. **Complete your daily activities** (water, sleep, challenges, etc.)
2. **Next day**: All daily progress resets to 0 automatically
3. **Your challenges remain enrolled** - just the daily completion resets
4. **Historical data** is preserved in the progress tracker

### Manual Testing:
- **"Refresh Day"** - Resets today's progress while keeping challenges
- **"Restore Tasks"** - Restores any missing challenges/tasks
- Both buttons are safe to use and won't delete your progress
